<p>Just like last time, we will be taking a look at data visualization! Thankfully, this time we will be focusing on perhaps the best baseball player of all time on the best team of all time: Babe Ruth of the New York Yankees! (Unfortunately we’ll have to include his statistics as a member of the Red Sox, but we’ll have to look over that)</p>
<p>The time series will give us an opportunity to see how his statistics progressed over his career.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>To look at Babe Ruth’s homeruns over his twenty-two seasons, we use this sql request:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>query&lt;-&quot;SELECT yearID,HR FROM Batting WHERE playerID=&#39;ruthba01&#39;&quot;
result&lt;-sqldf(query)</code></pre>
<p>Next, it is time for the visualization! The time series is similar to the scatterplot, except with this we’ll be able to see a line that will connect the points together that will help identify the progress over time!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),size=1/2)+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle(&quot;Babe Ruth&#39;s, aka The GOAT, Homeruns by Year&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Year&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Number of Homeruns&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>It’s always a fun time to look into the past at Yankees legends, so hopefully you’ll join me again and hopefully we’ll be able to take another look into the New York Yankees!</p>
