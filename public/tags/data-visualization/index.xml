      <description>Today we will be looking at bar plots and visualizing some more data!

      <description>Next on the data visualization list, histograms!
For this exercise, we will look at the weights of MLB players in the Lahman database.

      <description>Next on the data visualization list, histograms!
For this exercise, we will look at the weights of MLB players in the Lahman database.
library(Lahman) library(sqldf) library(ggplot2) The sql request is the following:
query&amp;lt;-&amp;quot;SELECT weight FROM Master&amp;quot; result&amp;lt;-sqldf(query) Similarly to a scatterplot, we can create all the labels and title all at once using ggplot2.
ggplot()+ geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color=&amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;,fill=&amp;quot;white&amp;quot;,bins=60)+ ggtitle(&amp;quot;Distribution of Baseball Player Bodyweight&amp;quot;)+ xlab(&amp;quot;Weight of player&amp;quot;)+ ylab(&amp;quot;Number of players&amp;quot;) ## Warning: Removed 854 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).</description>

      <description>Using the Lahman database, we’re going to look at homerun and strikeout statistics to make a scatterplot!
The first thing we do is download the libraries needed so we can get our data and the tools necessary to visualize this data.

The first thing we do is download the libraries needed so we can get our data and the tools necessary to visualize this data.
library(Lahman) library(sqldf) library(ggplot2) Then, we begin specifying exactly what we’re looking for. With this problem, we’re taking a look at players who managed to hit more than 400 homeruns and the amount of strikeouts they had.</description>

      <description>Just like last time, we will be taking a look at data visualization! Thankfully, this time we will be focusing on perhaps the best baseball player of all time on the best team of all time: Babe Ruth of the New York Yankees! (Unfortunately we’ll have to include his statistics as a member of the Red Sox, but we’ll have to look over that)
The time series will give us an opportunity to see how his statistics progressed over his career.</description>
