      <description>Just like last time, we will be taking a look at data visualization! Thankfully, this time we will be focusing on perhaps the best baseball player of all time on the best team of all time: Babe Ruth of the New York Yankees! (Unfortunately we’ll have to include his statistics as a member of the Red Sox, but we’ll have to look over that)
The time series will give us an opportunity to see how his statistics progressed over his career.</description>
